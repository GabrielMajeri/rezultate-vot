The project aims to be an aggregator for election information in Romania. The project will contain historic information for elections in Romania, will contain real time results for each election, as it will parse results published by BEC (Biroul Electoral Central) and it will also contain information about the budgets spent during the electoral campaign.

[See the project live](https://rezultatevot.ro)

The partial results published by BEC (Biroul Electoral Central) are often raw results that are not easily interpreted and give no meaningful information to regular users. The aim of the project is to aggregate the raw data and provide timely updates on the progression of voting results in Romanian elections.

## Contributing

This project is built by amazing volunteers and you can be one of them! Here's a list of ways in [which you can contribute to this project](.github/CONTRIBUTING.MD).

You can also list any pending features and planned improvements for the project here.

## Built With

### Programming languages

C# 7

### Platforms

.NET Core 2.2

### Package managers

NuGet

### Database technology & provider

* Amazon S3 Storage
* Amazon DynamoDB

## Repos and projects

TBD

## Deployment

#### Requirements

##### Prerequisites
* .NET Core 2.2 (backend)
* AWS CLI _(optional, only for deployment)_
* NodeJS (frontend)
* Docker (for running localstack or the API on local machine)

##### Run the project

- Run the localstack image with docker-compose:
  - `cd localstack`
  - `docker-compose up -d`

- _(not needed if developing locally)_ Add the required configuration settings.

  Use `setup.cmd` for Windows or `setup.sh` for Mac/Linux (remember to install the AWS CLI before this).

  This will add two settings:
  - `electionsConfig` which is the list of elections
  - `intervalInSeconds` which is the background task run interval

- Start the web API server, either:
  - use Visual Studio / VS Code to run the project
  - use the dotnet CLI:
    - `cd src\ElectionResults.WebApi`
    - `dotnet run`
  - run the Docker image using `docker-compose`
    - `cd src`
    - `docker-compose up -d`


#### Configuration

In appsettings.\{environment\}.json you'll find the following settings:
##### Settings section
- **bucketName**: "code4-presidential-2019"
  - the name of the bucket where CSV files are downloaded
- **tableName**: "electionresults"
  - the name of the DynamoDB Table where the JSON statistics are stored
##### AWS.Logging section
- specifies how much information should appear in the AWS logs

##### config.json
If you run the project on your local machine, you can also modify the file `localstack\config.json` before running `localstack\setup.cmd`

## CSV URLs and mappings
- PUT request on /api/settings/election-config with a JSON representation of a list of Election objects. This will overwrite the json from AWS Parameter Store.
- Each Election object has:
  - a list of candidates where information about them can be provided(candidate picture, name, CSV column id, etc.)
  - a list of BEC URLs, each file has the type of results(provisional, partial or final), location(Romania or Diaspora), URL
- An initial configuration is provided in the file `localstack\config.json`

#### Run unit tests
- `cd tests\ElectionResults.Tests`
- `dotnet test`
